# libicsneo C++ Example

This is an example console application which uses libicsneo to connect to an Intrepid Control Systems hardware device. It has examples for sending and receiving CAN & CAN FD traffic.

## Building

This example shows how to use the C++ version of libicsneo with CMake. This means that it will build libicsneo with your project.

When you first clone, be sure to run:
```shell
git submodule update --recursive --init
```
or clone with
```shell
git clone --recursive
```
to get all dependencies. If you haven't done this, `third-party/libicsneo` will be empty and you won't be able to build!

### Windows using Visual Studio 2017+

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Choose File->Open->CMake...
3. Navigate to your source directory and choose the CMakeLists.txt
4. Visual Studio will process the CMake project
5. Choose the dropdown attached to the green play button (labelled "select startup item...") in the toolbar
6. Select `libicsneocpp-example.exe`
7. Press the green play button to compile and run the example

### Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

1. Install dependencies with `sudo apt install build-essential ninja cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev`
2. Install PCAP file `sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev`
3. Create a build directory by running `mkdir -p build` within your clone
4. Enter the build directory with `cd build`
5. Run `cmake ..` to generate your Makefile
	- Hint! Running `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` will generate the proper scripts to build debug, and `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..` will generate the proper scripts to build with all optimizations on
6. Run `make libicsneocpp-example` to build
	- Hint! Speed up your build by using multiple processors! Use `make libicsneocpp-example -j#` where `#` is the number of cores/threads your system has plus one. For instance, on a standard 8 thread Intel i7, you might use `-j9` for an ~8x speedup.
7. Now run `sudo ./libicsneocpp-example` to run the example
	- Hint! In order to run without sudo, you will need to set up the udev rules. Instructions for doing so are coming soon.

### macOS

Instructions coming soon!
